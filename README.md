A web application to find friends to travel with based on the metrics of budget, destination, and schedule

## Motivation

Finding the exact time for frinds to schudle time of and destinations that people wish to visit is often diffcult. I felt that  Having a web application that helps with the logstics of travel will give people more time to focus on what they enjoy.
